# VUT IJC DU1

Source code for the first assignment in the IJC course at VUT FIT during the winter semester of 2018/2019.

## Assignment

Original assignment didn't survive, but the task was along the lines of the following:

- Implement reading of ppm images
- Implement defined algorithm for decoding data hidden in the image

I vaguely remember that there were also some other requirements, such as compiling multiple versions with kind of data allocation and comparing their performance.
